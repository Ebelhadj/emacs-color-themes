# Emacs color themes

Emacs ports of the ST2 color themes by Dayle Rees adapted slightly for Emacs

## Use

Just copy the themes and require them. Running install.sh will put the themes in your .emacs.d where you can then do

```elisp
(require 'color-theme-hickey)
```

## Hickey

Inspired by Goldfish. A dark theme.
