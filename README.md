# Emacs colour themes

Emacs versions of a selection of the brilliant ST2 colour themes by Dayle Rees adapted slightly for Emacs. 

Most of them have been modified for my personal taste and Emacs setup. 

All the themes are named after personal tech and programming heroes.

## Use

Just copy the themes and require them. Running install.sh will put the themes in your .emacs.d where you can then do

```elisp
(require 'color-theme-hickey)
(require 'color-theme-fogus)
(require 'color-theme-dorsey)
```

One line install script

```
git clone https://github.com/owainlewis/emacs-color-themes.git && cd emacs-color-themes && ./install.sh
```

## Hickey

A dark theme.
