# Emacs colour themes

Emacs ports of the brilliant ST2 colour themes by Dayle Rees adapted slightly for Emacs. 

Most of them have been modified for my personal taste and Emacs setup. 

All the themes are named after my personal heroes from the software world.

## Use

Just copy the themes and require them. Running install.sh will put the themes in your .emacs.d where you can then do

```elisp
(require 'color-theme-hickey)
(require 'color-theme-dorsey)
```

## Hickey

A dark theme.
